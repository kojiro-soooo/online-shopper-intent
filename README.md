# online-shopper-intent

Please view the online_shopper_intent.ipynb file for the full project.

A comparison of machine learning models based on their performance to predict online shopper intent. The dataset was taken from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset). It contains 12,330 instances, 18 attributes, and a binary target attribute.

To run, the .ipynb file should be uploaded to Google Colab as the code currently relies on the CSV file being stored in the user's Google Drive folder.
